# Just a Little Bit
## Introduction
If just a little bit were to go missing... would it really even matter?

## Investigation
We try to decrypt it using binary.

```

Since its saying something is missing, lets try a lower byte length than the standard 8. 

A byte length of 7 decodes the binary into a flag.
