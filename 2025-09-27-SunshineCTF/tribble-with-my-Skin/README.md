# Tribble with my Skin - Misc
## Introduction
My Minecraft account got hacked and now my skin seems to be a little off...

Might be having trouble with the tribbles...

Mind checking it out? My Minecraft username is "oatzs".

PS: A Minecraft account/instance is not required for this challenge. The most recently used skin is the suspicious one.

## Investigation
First we find a website that can do minecraft skin lookup, that being [NameMC](https://namemc.com/).

Then we look up the [account](https://namemc.com/skin/4ee8b166aa874c73) and download their skin.

The flag is written in orange as part of the skin.
