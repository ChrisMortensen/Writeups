Ink between the lines. 			  		
The quiet parts carry weight. 			 			
Margins remember. 		  	 	
Breaths of paper. 		  	 	
Look where nothing lives. 			 	  
There and not there. 		 	   
Tabs quarrel with spaces. 		  	 	
Count what you cannot see. 		    	
Even silence has grammar. 			  	 
The page hums. 			 	  
Focus on the gaps.  	     
Zoom, never copy. 		 	  	
Lossless eyes only. 			  		
A faint rhythm remains.  	     
End of message. 			 	  
Light reveals the hidden. 		 	   
Shadows keep the tally. 				  	
Read the endings.  	     
Let the void speak. 		   		
Between keystrokes. 		    	
Witness whispers. 		 		  
Now listen closely.
