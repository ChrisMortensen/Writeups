We start by doing a reverse image search. This does not return anything useful.

Then lets see if we can create a prompt for a search engine.

`15-17 september sydney gala dinner jp morgan microsoft canva`

Her we find out that [The Tech Council of Australia](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tech-council-of-australia/) has posted about the event on linkedin.

We find a post that contains a [link](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tech-council-of-australia_national-tech-summit-day-2-activity-7372141989489922049-j7o8/) to the website of the event.

From here we navigate to where event information is displayed: `Events > National Tech Summit 2025 > When + Where`. We then search for dinner on the page and find the only instance where it is mentioned.
