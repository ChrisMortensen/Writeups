The code is a attractive monstrosity
Knock the code down scream it
The code is a prestigious song
Say the code

The program's advancement obliterate him
Print the program
Scream like a maintenance revolution
The developper was gone

The debugger is a disadvantage now
if the developper otherwise print the debugger
He is a professional researcher
Build Him up Shout it

The compiler was very powerful
The developper was a regrettable monster
Whisper the compiler 
Shout the developper

The challenge was like a pleasurable song. say it
The flag is like clandestine, undetected, undisclosed. say it
The author was like chuckling hard.
Build Him up Shout it

The solution is like a CHALLENGING speech. print it
The solution is like a Disastrous song. print it
Shout 51

The author was like chuckling hard.
Build Him up Shout it
The challenge was like a pleasurable song. say it
The compiler was very powerful
Whisper the compiler 

My dreams are like invisible champagne. whisper them
My hopes were like a vulnerable journey. whisper them
My pain is like a spectacular truth. whisper it
The solution is like a CHALLENGING speech. whisper it

The conclusion is certainly here
Build the conclusion up up up
Shout it

The challenge was like a pleasurable song. say it
Scream like a inexplicable truth
